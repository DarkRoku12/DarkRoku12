Hi, my name is __Enmanuel__, I'm a __software developer__ (or at least I believe so).

**Things I like:**

Some of my thoughts are in my blog: https://code.darkroku12.ovh/ <br>

Future goal: Be an active maintainer of the LuaJIT project.

***Dear recruiters, hiring managers and CEO's***

My GitHub is mostly composed of personal projects and *nonsense* take-home tests companies ask you to do to have a chance at their opening.
You may find similar ~bullshit~ within my BitBucket as well: https://bitbucket.org/DarkRoku12/workspace/repositories/

If you came here by chance and you'd like me to do another silly take-home test, then you're not interested in hiring me; you just want me to be part of an unfair process where, after receiving very positive feedback, you won't move on with me. 

In case you like my profile and my experience, you'll take care to look at these past, public projects as well as my blog, and then you can judge for yourself if I'm this *'rare unicorn you want to hire'* (let's be honest, you could not find someone better, because as soon as you do, the previous statement will be true).
If I'm still your dream hire, then reach out to me to schedule an interview or two.

*I'm only asking you to not make me lose my time, patience, and hopes, thanks!*
