Hi, my name is __Enmanuel__, I'm a __software developer__ (or at least I believe so).

Things I like:
- Anime
- Some movies
- Multiplayer videogames
- Soccer
- Meeting people
- Coding
- Compilers
- Optimization techniques

Some of my thoughts are in my blog: https://code.darkroku12.ovh/

Future goal: Be an active maintainer of the LuaJIT project.
